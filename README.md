# Employee-excel-analysis

# Objective
The aim of this project is to analyze employee performance, salary distribution, and attrition trends using Excel. The final output is an interactive HR dashboard that provides insights into:
•	Employee attrition
•	Department-wise salary
•	Age group distribution

# Dataset Overview
•	Source: HR Records
•	Columns Used:
o	EmployeeID
o	Age
o	Department
o	Salary (Monthly Income)
o	AttritionStatus (Yes/No)

# Tools Used
•	Microsoft Excel (PivotTables, Charts, Slicers)
•	Excel 2007 or later

# Step 1: Data Preparation
•	Imported HR records into Excel.
•	Cleaned the data by checking for:
o	Missing values
o	Inconsistent formats
o	Invalid entries (e.g., negative salaries or ages)
# Step 2: Attrition Analysis
•	Created a PivotTable to analyze attrition based on:
o	Department
o	Gender
•	Used a pie chart to visually represent attrition counts (Yes/No) across departments.
# Insights:
•	Majority of attrition occurred in the Sales department.
•	Research & Development had the lowest attrition rate.
# Step 3: Salary Distribution by Department
•	Created a PivotTable summarizing Monthly Income by Department.
•	Used a clustered bar chart to visualize the total salary distribution.
# Insights:
•	Sales has the highest total monthly income.
•	Human Resources has the lowest salary sum.
# Step 4: Age Distribution
•	Grouped employees into 5 age ranges:
o	18–27
o	28–37
o	38–47
o	48–57
o	58–67
•	Created a donut chart to display the employee count by age group.
# Insights:
•	The highest number of employees falls into the 28–37 age range.
•	Older age groups (48–67) are underrepresented.
## Step 5: HR Dashboard Creation
•	Combined all charts and PivotTables into a single dashboard:
o	Pie chart for attrition analysis
o	Bar chart for department-wise income
o	Donut chart for age group distribution
•	Applied slicers for:
o	Department
o	Gender
o	Attrition status (for interactivity)
